# SwiftServer

##Disclaimer
For this to run, please change the path in the Database.swift to wherever this project was downloaded to.

To check where this directory is, open a terminal app and type pwd.

Take that path by copying it and pasting it to dbName = "insert here your present working directory "

ALSO was only able to insert into the database with router.get not sure why

That's it thank you!
