## Disclaimer for the clientSide:

had a socket connection error that says that the information sent over unsafe connection is not acceptable. Was not able to fix it.


## Disclaimer for the ServerSide:
For this to run, please change the path in the Database.swift to wherever this project was downloaded to.

To check where this directory is, open a terminal app and type pwd.

Take that path by copying it and pasting it to dbName = "insert here your present working directory "


That's it thank you!
